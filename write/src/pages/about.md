# About

_My personal background._

Well hello there! My name is Trevor. I'm a software developer. I strive to learn new things every day and share what I learn.

The skills I specialize in are in the DevOps / systems programming spaces.

Here are some examples:

- Automation (like CI/CD, tests, CLIs, and scripts).
- Command line (like Linux, Unix, and Vim).
- Version control (like Git).
- Systems programming languages (like Rust).
