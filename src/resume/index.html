      <p>Merrick Christensen said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Trevor brought a level of organization and consistency the project
          desperately needed. He helped lay down the ground work for scaling up
          the project's team size. Trevor helped me grow in my technical skills,
          my people skills and in navigating the terrain of formalizing a 'lab'
          project and taking it to production. He is the most organized
          developer I've ever met and his passion about learning has a positive
          effect on everyone around him. Trevor is a top notch engineer and has
          something that is far more rare; the emotional intelligence, optimism
          and people skills to move ideas forward."

      <p>Jason Staten said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Bionic developer. Trevor Miller is one with the computer. He uses
          automation to organize his life like no one else. He frees his mind to
          focus on higher-order problems rather than wasting cycles on the
          minutiae of coding. Also, he constantly measures himself with several
          tools to ensure he's always improving and staying efficient. Trevor is
          a multiplier for team productivity. On a team of 3, his pragmatic
          approach to development allowed us to keep pace with teams of 10. I
          can't recommend Trevor enough, and I hope to work with him again in
          the future."
        </p>

      <p>Adam Christiansen said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Trevor is as reliable and trustworthy as it gets. I've never met
          somebody so well organized and goal oriented. It was a pleasure
          working with him and continuing to be friends with him since. He is
          optimistic, helpful, patient, and self-aware. I also worked with him
          on a few side projects and I would happily do so again. His coding
          expertise and tech fluency was constantly impressive."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Murphy Randle said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "[Trevor] is a product-oriented engineer with an incredible eye for
          detail and a loving demeanor. Trevor is intelligent and capable, but
          inquisitive and humble. He's good at what he does, but he's always
          ready to learn more."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Lail Brown said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Trevor is one of the most skilled developers I've ever had the
          pleasure of working with. He has an outstanding eye for detail and the
          rare ability to zoom out of any task he takes on and quickly
          understand context in relation to both the system design and the user
          experience. He's always able to build with a keen eye toward
          maintainability and efficiency. Furthermore, and more importantly,
          Trevor is an invaluable asset as a team member. He never hesitates to
          document his work, and he's a great pair and mentor for other
          developers. He takes a strong role in building a great team culture in
          ways big and small. He's always willing to speak up and to contribute
          to building processes that make work better for everyone around him
          and our whole team is better for having worked with him."
