## Recommendations

> "Trevor brought a level of organization and consistency the project desperately needed. He helped lay down the ground work for scaling up the project's team size. Trevor helped me grow in my technical skills, my people skills and in navigating the terrain of formalizing a 'lab' project and taking it to production. He is the most organized developer I've ever met and his passion about learning has a positive effect on everyone around him. Trevor is a top notch engineer and has something that is far more rare; the emotional intelligence, optimism and people skills to move ideas forward."

Jason Staten said:

> "Bionic developer. Trevor Miller is one with the computer. He uses automation to organize his life like no one else. He frees his mind to focus on higher-order problems rather than wasting cycles on the minutiae of coding. Also, he constantly measures himself with several tools to ensure he's always improving and staying efficient. Trevor is a multiplier for team productivity. On a team of 3, his pragmatic approach to development allowed us to keep pace with teams of 10\. I can't recommend Trevor enough, and I hope to work with him again in the future."

Adam Christiansen said:

> "Trevor is as reliable and trustworthy as it gets. I've never met somebody so well organized and goal oriented. It was a pleasure working with him and continuing to be friends with him since. He is optimistic, helpful, patient, and self-aware. I also worked with him on a few side projects and I would happily do so again. His coding expertise and tech fluency was constantly impressive."

Murphy Randle said:

> "[Trevor] is a product-oriented engineer with an incredible eye for detail and a loving demeanor. Trevor is intelligent and capable, but inquisitive and humble. He's good at what he does, but he's always ready to learn more."

Lail Brown said:

> "Trevor is one of the most skilled developers I've ever had the pleasure of working with. He has an outstanding eye for detail and the rare ability to zoom out of any task he takes on and quickly understand context in relation to both the system design and the user experience. He's always able to build with a keen eye toward maintainability and efficiency. Furthermore, and more importantly, Trevor is an invaluable asset as a team member. He never hesitates to document his work, and he's a great pair and mentor for other developers. He takes a strong role in building a great team culture in ways big and small. He's always willing to speak up and to contribute to building processes that make work better for everyone around him and our whole team is better for having worked with him."
