# About

_My personal background._

Well hello there! My name is Trevor. I'm a software developer. I strive to learn new things every day and share what I learn.

My specialty is DevOps. Here are some examples:

- Automation with CI/CD.
- System work with Unix-like shells (Linux and macOS).
- Text editing with Vim.
- Version control with Git.
