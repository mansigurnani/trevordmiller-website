- CLI > GUI.
- Module / library > framework.
- Automation > manual.
- Compile-time > run-time.
- Compiled > interpreted.
- Safe > forgiving.
- Self contained > side effects.
- Modules with tests > tight coupling.
- Blackbox tests > tautology tests.
- Linting to prevent problems > linting opinionated preferences.
- Code formatter > code style arguments.
- Prevent merging until passing checks > code reviewer checks.
- Semantic versions > in-place updates.
- Generated documentation > remembered documentation.
- Lightweight > feature-rich.
